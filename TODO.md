# What can be done

- clean files : remove uneeded files (protected/data/schema.mysql.sql ...)
- Write install note (for yii noobs)
- Write content on _about_ page.
- Move css style from `protected/view/site/index.php` to css/main.css
- css style
- link and/or markdown example/cheat-page
- move javascript to a file (?)
- move js refresh rate from `/protected/controllers/SiteController::actionIndex()` to `config/main.php` (so became a param)
- i think that writing unit/fonctionnal tests is a waste of time for a so small stuff, but why not...
